# Overview

This project is a machine learning model that predicts movie genres based on textual descriptions. It uses GloVe embeddings to transform text data into vectors and employs traditional machine learning classifiers, specifically Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify genres.


## Dataset

The dataset is structured as follows:

Training data: ID ::: TITLE ::: GENRE ::: DESCRIPTION
